// Updating Arrays in State
//=================================================
// Recap
// You can put arrays into state, but you canâ€™t change them.
// Instead of mutating an array, create a new version of it, and update the state to it.
// You can use the [...arr, newItem] array spread syntax to create arrays with new items.
// You can use filter() and map() to create new arrays with filtered or transformed items.
// You can use Immer to keep your code concise.
